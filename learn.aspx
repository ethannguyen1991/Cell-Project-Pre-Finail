Shelia is in good health and is majoring in biology. She also loves walks on the beach, hiking and her cocker spaniel, Lester. Sheila’s boyfriend Simon also loves hiking on their favorite trail, at Lapham peak. You enjoy your neighboring intestinal cells, you have always gotten along with your community, like your parent before you and their parent before them. You want to be the best intestinal cell you can be and are excited to contribute to the health and well-being of Sheila! 
You will be given a variety of scenarios in which you have to decide where you are in the cell cycle and how to proceed. Use your knowledge of the cell cycle, and the information provided about intestinal epithelial cells to make the best decisions.
